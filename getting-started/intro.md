# Getting Started

> _This guide is made for people who are new to making AVNs. It will tell you enough of what you need to know to make informed decisions. It is not a step-by-step tutorial. In-depth tutorials and installation guides are in the Resources tab._

Not only is making an AVN a lot of work, getting started has historically been pretty difficult. What tools to use, where to find them, what to prioritize, even what's legal or not, are questions that every new dev inevitably runs into. New devs have to worry about new tools, animation, audio, shaders, and all sorts of crazy things.

::: info EXAMPLE
This issue might be confounding to a new dev, but the 25th nipple bone is an unfortunate reality for some Koikatsu devs.

Luckily... this guide is here to make your journey a little easier. A little advice - before installing and making any major decisions, we recommended that you read to the end to get a holistic view of what goes into being a developer.
