# Release

New devs are always fretting about what's appropriate for their first release, but unfortunately there's no right answer! This question gets asked enough, so you can read more about what people have to say in this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/lewdgames/comments/1b6ouaj/how_important_is_something_like_sound_for_a_01/).

Some devs are ashamed about the quality of their game on relase, but the best way to improve is to put your game out there and get feedback. Nobody is perfect on their first time! Getting out there and improving is more impressing than talking about how great your unreleased AVN is!
:::

The only thing stopping your AVN from coming to fruition is motivation, so whether you rush to release or wait until you have something you love, do whatever _keeps you motivated_. No level of optimized release schedule is going to match the long term motivation for a project that comes from genuinely enjoying what you do.

Alas, once you're ready to release, upload to Itch, F95, MEGA, or wherever you want, then drop a link on [AVN_Lovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AVN_Lovers/), [AVNCommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/AVNCommunity/) and wherever else you'd like people to see your game, and wait for people play your game! The traffic might be disappointing at first but if you keep improving and keep releasing, you'll eventually get noticed. Quality and frequency of updates are the two of the most important things to a developers success.

#### Keep at it and eventually you'll succeed!
