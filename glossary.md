**Netorase** is where a character shares their SO with others aka "hotwife".\
**Netori** is where a character is the one who is "stealing" or "snatching" away the partner of another.

The nuance of this term is not widely known so NTR is often used as a synonym for cuckolding, or even non-consensual sex.

:::danger CONTROVERSIAL
The topic of NTR can be polarizing, which has led devs to label games as having NTR or explicitly not having NTR. Both camps have a passionate base of very vocal players who actively search for or avoid games that have NTR. No matter what your stance is, this can be a divisive topic.
