# Installing Illusion Games

::: danger WARNING
The AVN community strongly frowns upon pirating and this is not lip service. But it's understood that not everybody can afford the game, so we won't make you search for it.

## Koikatsu

### Installation

To use Koikatsu as a modding tool you can obtain either Koikatsu (KK) or Koikatsu Sunshine (KKS). AFAIK the differences are minimal if you're using the game for modding purposes.

There are two ways to do this...

#### Purchase the game legally through Steam or another website. You can then apply the [KK-HF_Patch](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KK-HF_Patch/releases) for KK and the [KKS-HF_Patch ](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKS-HF_Patch)for KKS.

> Note that you can no longer purchase KKS without going through an enormous amount of effort.

#### Illegally through [BetterRepack](https://dl.betterrepack.com/public/) which comes with the games and mods pre-installed.

> [Reddit guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/KoikatsuParty/comments/nmzt57/a_guide_on_how_to_get_betterrepack_hf_patch_and/) for more information but there are reservations about using [kPlug](https://discord.com/channels/447114928785063977/447120583189331968/735439118728822784) that are worth considering.

## Honey Select

### Installation

To use Honey Select as a modding tool you can obtain either Honey Select (HS aka HS1) or Honey Select 2 (HS2). HS 2 is known to have better graphics due to a more recent Unity build, but the real power of these games as tools comes from the mods that people have written for them. And HS1, having been around longer, has had the time to have more support. This means more community assets, more mods, more developers, and just more resources on the game in general.

Again, there are two ways to do this...

#### Purchase the game legally through Steam or another website. You can then apply the [HS2-HF_Patch](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/HS2-HF_Patch) for HS2 and this [mod pack](https://dl.betterrepack.com/public/) for HS1.

> There may be a better solution out there for patching HS1.

#### Illegally through [BetterRepack](https://dl.betterrepack.com/public/) which comes with the games and mods pre-installed.

> There is no BetterRepack available for Honey Select 1.
